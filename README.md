# NBA_Stats_Analysis
### Intro:

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender’s hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.

There are 19647 observations and 48 variables in this data.
This data is the data of NBA players on regular seasons.
Each observation (row) includes the statistics per game of a player during one particular NBA
regular season.
